# Intro

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Adrian Bienias](https://bienias.dev), developer behind this software.

## Motivation

During my career, I was using a lot of different email marketing solutions, but none of them suited my needs in terms of fair pricing.

Monthly billings by the size of the list sounded unfair to me (storing emails in databases isn't that expensive). Plans that billed for emails sent, were also overpriced.

That's why I brought this software to life.

## Pricing comparison (10 000 contacts example)

| Email service          | Monthly send limit | Monthly cost                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Mailchimp              | 100 000            | $100                           |
| AWeber                 | Unlimited          | $79.99                         |
| GetResponse            | Unlimited          | $79                            |
| **OSEMS** + Amazon SES | Unlimited          | $5 + $1 per 10 000 emails sent |

OSEMS is free of charge. $5 is the cost of hosting the app on [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform?refcode=80e257abf861) (by using this link you even get 60 days for free).

## What this software does?

You can create lists, embed customized signup forms on your websites, send newsletters to your subscribers, and schedule autoresponders.

OSEMS is free, but you need to host it somewhere and use SMTP server of your choice.

For SMTP the best option (in my opinion) is [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) that offers sending emails for as low as $0.10 per 1000 outbound emails (you pay only for what you send).

Besides that, storing millions of emails on your lists can costs you totally nothing if you decide to use [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/pricing) Hobby plan (5 GB database).

The only fixed cost is a hosting that you need to use in order to have this app up and running. I recommend [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform?refcode=80e257abf861) App Platform which can cost you $5/month.
